# Lawn Bowls Local Tournament App

A lightweight tournament management system built for local **lawn bowls** events. The application handles player registration, match scheduling, scoring, standings, and leaderboard presentation in a clean, easy-to-use interface. It was designed to streamline administration for small competitions without needing complex tournament software.

## What It Does

- Registers players and organizes events
- Generates schedules using Swiss or Round-Robin formats with no repeat matchups
- Manages rink rotation
- Allows match score entry with mirrored scoring support
- Applies standard tiebreak rules (win/draw/loss points and optional bonus rules)
- Displays real-time standings and leaderboards
- Imports and exports players and results via Excel files

The app is built using **Python** and **Streamlit**, optimized for rapid deployment in a local event context.

## Development & Support

This project is maintained on an **as-needed** basis. It is not under continuous active development. Feature additions and updates are implemented only when requested by local tournament organizers, and new builds are deployed specifically for scheduled events.

There is no public hosted version and no guaranteed update cycle.

## Status

The app is stable and fully functional for its intended purpose but **not in active development**. Future updates are performed **on demand only**.

## Building / Running

Anyone who wishes to run it locally may install dependencies and start the application:


## Technology

- **Python**
- **Streamlit** for UI
- Excel import/export support
- JSON or database storage options depending on deployment needs
